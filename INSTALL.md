## Installing gz
The currently supported games are:

-   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (NTSC-U/J version 1.0)
-   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (NTSC-U/J version 1.1)
-   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (NTSC-U/J version 1.2)
-   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (NTSC-U/J Wii VC release)

There are a few methods of using this software, described below.

### Using gz with an emulator / flash cart
**Windows:** Drag and drop a compatible rom onto the `patch.bat` script.

**GNU/Linux:** Run `./patch <rom-file>`.

A patched rom will be created. It can be played with an emulator or transferred
to a flash cart. For emulator usage, you will need to enable Expansion Pak
emulation. On some emulators, you may need to change CPU Core Style to
Interpreter. For use with a flash cart, your N64 will need an Expansion Pak.

### Using gz on the Wii VC
**Windows:** Drag and drop a compatible Wii WAD onto the `patch-wad.bat`
script.

**GNU/Linux:** Run `./patch-wad <wad-file>`.

A patched WAD file will be created.
This WAD can be installed as a channel on an emulated Wii, or on a homebrew Wii
Console using a WAD manager. The original Ocarina of Time channel can be
installed alongside the patched WAD, and will not be overwritten. Homebrewing a
Wii console and using a WAD manager is not covered by this guide.

### Enabling line features on N64
**Windows:** Select both your patched rom and a microcode rom, then drag and
drop them onto the `inject_ucode.bat` script.

**GNU/Linux:** Run `./inject_ucode <patched-rom> <ucode-rom>`.

The currently known and supported microcode roms are `Hey You, Pikachu! (U)`
and `Hey You, Pikachu! (J)`.

### Using gz with a Gameshark
*Note: Gameshark support has been deprecated. It is still provided, but without
guarantees.*

*Note: These instructions only cover Windows users.*

You will need:

-   An N64 with a supported game cartridge, and an Expansion Pak.
-   A Gameshark with a functional parallel port (note that some 3.3s only have
    dummy ports).
-   A Parallel to USB adapter cable with bidirectional communication support.
    The included Gameshark utility is designed to function with a Moschip
    MCS7705 cable, and has only been tested with a version 3.3 Gameshark.
-   [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/), a usb driver tool.

Follow these steps;

1.  Boot the Gameshark with your game cartridge. If your game requires a
    special keycode to boot, you'll first need to boot the Gameshark with a
    game that works with the default keycode, select the the required keycode
    in the Key Codes menu, and then reboot with the game you wish to use with
    gz.
2.  In the Select Cheat Codes menu, select your game and make sure the `(M)`
    code is active, if one exists.
3.  In the Start Game submenu, enable the Code Generator option, and select
    Start Game With Selected Codes.
4.  Connect the Gameshark to your computer with your Parallel to USB adapter
    cable.
5.  Start Zadig and select the Gameshark in the device the list (probably named
    USB Device or something similar).
6.  Select libusbK in the driver list and click Replace Driver.
7.  Navigate to the directory that corresponds to your game and run the
    `upload.bat` script. This will instruct the Gameshark utility to upload gz
    to the game's memory, and then disconnect the Gameshark. The operation will
    take a while.
8.  When the upload is completed, you can disconnect the USB cable and start
    playing.
